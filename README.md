#Attendance
This is a multi purpose attendance system.

#Features
It has been built on PHP CodeIgniter. The idea of the system is that, the admin has the ability to add users, where an automatic email will be sent to then notifying them along with a unique QR Code, for them to scan in order to check in or out. As long as they are connected to the configured network (e.g. office network) then they will be able to update their status.
